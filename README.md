  - Appwrite (for backend services)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Appwrite instance running (either locally or using Appwrite Cloud)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ujjwal-270/storage_management_solution.git
cd storage_management_solution
```

### Install Dependencies

-npm install

### Setup Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file in the root of the project and add your Appwrite project details:

-NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=<your-appwrite-endpoint>
-NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=<your-appwrite-project-id>
-NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=<your-appwrite-database-id>

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. If you haven't already, create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
2. After logging in, click on **New Project**.
3. Select your GitHub repository and follow the prompts.
4. Vercel will automatically detect that this is a Next.js app and configure the deployment for you.
5. Once the deployment process is complete, Vercel will provide a live URL where your application is hosted.

### Configure Appwrite in Production

Once your application is deployed to Vercel, you need to configure your Appwrite instance for production:

- Ensure your Appwrite endpoint is publicly accessible.
- Update the environment variables in Vercel:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=<your-appwrite-public-endpoint>`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=<your-appwrite-project-id>`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=<your-appwrite-database-id>`

To update the environment variables in Vercel:

1. Go to your project in the Vercel dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**.
3. Add the required environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID`).
4. Click **Save** and redeploy the project to apply the changes.

After deploying, your application should be accessible on the Vercel URL, with all functionality tied to the live Appwrite backend.
